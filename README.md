# templates

This is a repo full of templates for various programming tasks.

This repo contains:

- Latex folder
  - **notes.tex**     - a note-taking template. 
  - **prog_hw.tex**   - a template for doing typed homework assignments that may contain snippets of code.
  - **article.tex**   - a template for plain-jane articles.

**Note** - "<fold>" and "<efold>" are markers that I've included so that editing these files will be easy because they hide all of the code between the them. Please check out my .vimrc file in my **dotfiles** repo under the section: "Custom file editing" to learn more.
